I am a Graduate Student at the Learning Agents Research Group [LARG](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/students.shtml) advised by [Prof. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/index.shtml). My research focuses on the sub-field of Machine Learning called Reinforcement Learning. Within this field I have worked on a variety of projects that looks at different aspects of the problem, from optimization perspectives of TD learning, using adversarial techniques for transfering policies, to multi-agent RL and application of RL to knowledge bases. Take a look at my [Publications](https://idurugkar.github.io/publications/) page for an up to date list of my papers.

I also coordinate the weekly [RL Reading Group](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rlrg). Contact me in case you are interested in joining in our discussions.

Previously, I have been a Master's student at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) and have worked with [Sridhar Mahadevan](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html) at the [Autonomous Learning Lab](http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/) on both Deep Learning and Deep RL projects.
