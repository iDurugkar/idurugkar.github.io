I am a Graduate Student at the Learning Agents Research Group [LARG](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/students.shtml) advised by [Prof. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/index.shtml). My research focuses on the sub-field of Machine Learning called Reinforcement Learning. I also coordinate the weekly [RL Reading Group](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ishand/RLRG.html).

Previously, I have been a Master's student at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) and have worked with [Sridhar Mahadevan](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html) at the [Autonomous Learning Lab](http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/).
